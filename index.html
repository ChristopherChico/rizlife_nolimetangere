            <h1>Noli Me Tángere</h1>
            <p>
                Noli Me Tángere ("Touch Me Not") is a classic novel by Dr. José Rizal, first published in
                1887 in Berlin Germany, which became a crucial contribution to the Philippine struggle for
                independence. It remains a powerful social critique of Spanish colonial rule that exposed the
                systemic corruption, abuses, and injustices perpetrated upon Filipinos by Spanish authorities and
                the Catholic clergy in the 19th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                The novel, set in the fictional town of San Diego, establishes the journey of an idealistic
                Filipino returning from Europe, Juan Crisostomo Ibarra, who sees the deep-seated oppression
                and moral decay of colonial society firsthand. With a diverse cast of characters that shows aspects
                of Philippine society, Rizal draws attention to the following key points: abuse of power, religious
                hypocrisy, social inequality, and the call for reform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Written originally in Spanish, Noli Me Tángere was a wake-up call for Filipinos and the
                Philippines' colonizer, the Spaniards, to the state of desperation under colonial rule. Its
                revolutionary contents caused it to be banned in the Philippines but secretly circulated to be an
                inspiration to the Propaganda Movement and the nationalist sentiments that helped ignite the
                Philippine Revolution of 1896. It remains a core work in Philippine nationalism, together with its
                sequel, El Filibusterismo.

            <h2></h2>
            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda (June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896)
                was a prominent Filipino nationalist, writer, and reformist who played a crucial role in the Philippine
                nationalist movement against Spanish colonial rule. Born in Calamba, Laguna, Rizal was the
                seventh of eleven children in a wealthy family. His brilliance was evident from a young age,
                excelling in various subjects, including the sciences, literature, and languages.
            </p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
                Jose Rizal's mother was his first instructor, teaching him to read and pray while also encouraging
                him to write poetry. Rizal learned Spanish and Latin from private teachers before attending a
                private school in Biñan. At the age of 11, he enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, where he
                excelled in philosophy, physics, chemistry, and natural history classes. He obtained a land
                surveyor and assessor's degree from Ateneo while studying Philosophy and Letters at the
                University of Santo Tomas (UST). However, in search of new opportunities to broaden his
                knowledge, he journeyed to Europe, where he studied medicine at the Universities of Madrid and
                Heidelberg. His exposure to liberal ideologies in Europe had a significant impact on his later works
                and beliefs.
            </p>

            <h3>Execution</h3>
            <p>
                On December 30, 1896 Spanish authorities ordered the execution of José Rizal by firing squad
                in Luneta Manila. His death became a pivotal moment in Philippine history. Although Rizal had
                always pushed for changes instead of revolt, his killing sparked anger across the country and
                brought Filipinos together in their fight for independence. People see Rizal as a hero who gave
                his life for his beliefs. His story and writings still motivate Filipinos today to strive for liberty,
                fairness, and equal treatment.

                        <h2 class="section-title">Noli Me Tángere by Dr. Jose Rizal</h2>
                        <p class="section-subtitle" style="text-align: justify;">
                            Noli Me Tángere was written by Dr. José Rizal between 1884 and 1887, beginning in Madrid and completing it in Berlin. The novel was inspired by the oppression faced by Filipinos under Spanish rule, particularly the abuses of Spanish friars and government officials. 
                            The novel criticizes the corruption of Spanish friars, the exploitation of Filipinos, and the oppressive colonial government. It also highlights the lack of political representation for Filipinos, the abuses of the Catholic Church, and the social inequalities under Spanish rule. Due to its bold message, Noli Me Tángere was banned in the Philippines, and Rizal was labeled a subversive.
                            Despite this, the novel ignited Filipino nationalism and played a crucial role in stimulating the movement for independence. Rizal’s work remains a key part of Philippine literature and a symbol of resistance to colonial rule.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                Noli Me Tángere follows the story of Juan Crisostomo Ibarra, a Filipino character who had just returned after studying in Europe, hoping to bring reforms to his homeland. Upon his return, he discovers that Don Rafael, his father, was wrongly accused, imprisoned, and died in prison because of the abuses made by the Spanish friars, particularly by Padre Damaso.<br><br>
                                He is determined to change and modernize the society by planning to build a school, but his efforts are sabotaged by corrupt officials and the clergy. His love for Maria Clara, who was the daughter of Kapitan Tiago, a wealthy and influential man, was also manipulated by Padre Damaso, who reveals that she is his biological daughter.<br><br>
                                Throughout the novel, a man named Elias warns Crisostomo Ibarra of the enduring injustices in the country. Basilio and Crispin are two young sacristans who suffer severe abuse at the hands of the friars. Crispin is falsely accused of stealing and mysteriously disappears, while Basilio flees and later finds his mother, Sisa, who has gone mad after losing her children to the cruelty of the Spanish authorities.<br><br>
                                Eventually Crisostomo Ibarra was framed for rebellion and was arrested and sentenced to death, but he escaped with the help of Elias. Basilio witnesses the tragic death of his mother, Sisa, a victim of the friars’ cruelty. The novel ends with Maria Clara believing that Crisostomo Ibarra is dead as she enters the convent. Elias, on the other hand, dies because of being heavily wounded while helping Crisostomo Ibarra escape.
